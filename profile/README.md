# Welcome to Shareish ! :wave:

Shareish (Share & Cherish) is an open-source map-based web platform to foster diverse solidarity practices (including mutual aid, non-monetary sharing, network-generalized exchange, gift economy, indirect reciprocity, random acts of kindness, community economy, stooping, gleaning, grafiteria/donnerie, ...). This can be replicated/adapted by local community groups.
